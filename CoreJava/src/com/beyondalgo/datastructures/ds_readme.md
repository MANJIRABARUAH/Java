Stacks
---------------

The stack is a data structure used to store the collection of objects. The object inserted using push and removed using pop operations with last-in-first-out (LIFO) principle.

Stack data structure uses in application function call stack, convert an expression from the different format and more. The image shows the user can remove the stone from the top of the stack and add stone to the top.

Stack section explains how to implement the stack and various application related problems which use stack operation

Algorithm Explanation
	
	- Stack supports push and pop operations. 
	- Push operation adds the item to the array.
	- Pop operation removes the item from an array.
	- Push and pop operation use index to move positions.
	- The stack data structure can implement using an array and linked list.
